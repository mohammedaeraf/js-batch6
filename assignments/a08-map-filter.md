## **📘 Assignment 08: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()` Functions**

### **Problem 01: Modify Numbers Using `map()`**

You are given an array of **numbers**. Use the **`map()`** method to create a new array called **`modifiedNumbers`**, where:

* Each **even number** is multiplied by **2**.
* Each **odd number** is incremented by **1**.

---

**Sample Input:**

```js
const numbers = [4, 7, 12, 15, 9];
```

**Expected Output:**

```js
[8, 8, 24, 16, 10]
```

**Instructions:**

1. Use the **`map()`** function to iterate over the `numbers` array.
2. Check if each number is **even** or **odd**.
3. Modify it accordingly and return the new array.
4. Print **`modifiedNumbers`** to the console.

### **Problem 02: Filter Even Numbers Using `filter()`**

You are tasked with creating a program that filters out specific numbers from an array.

---

**Task Instructions:**

1. **Create an Array of Numbers**

   ```js
   const numbers = [12, 5, 8, 130, 44, 3, 25, 60, 7, 90];
   ```
2. **Filter Out Even Numbers**

   * Use the **`filter()`** method to create a new array called `evenNumbers` that contains only the **even numbers** from the `numbers` array.
   * Print the result.

**Expected Output:**

```
Even Numbers: [12, 8, 130, 44, 60, 90]
```

### **Problem 03: Find the Total Using `reduce()`**

You are given an array of **bill amounts**. Use the **`reduce()`** method to calculate the **total bill**.

---

**Sample Input:**

```js
const bills = [250, 450, 300, 150, 600];
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Total Bill: 1750
```

**Instructions:**

1. Use the **`reduce()`** function to sum up all the values in the `bills` array.
2. Store the result in a variable called **`totalBill`**.
3. Print `"Total Bill: "` followed by the result.
